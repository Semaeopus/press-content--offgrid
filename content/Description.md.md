Off Grid is a moddable stealth hacking game where data is your most powerful weapon. You play a technophobe single dad who is oblivious to the cityâ€™s prying and spying, corporate-sponsored government until a series of dark events unfold. The contemporary storyline follows real-world events surrounding data privacy, and gameplay utilises unique mechanics that allow you to manipulate the world and people around you with the data they unwittingly leave behind.
