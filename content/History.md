## How did we get here

Off Grid is the debut game from the award-winning indie studio Semaeopus. In development since 2013, the game was initially inspired when Rich heard Eben Moglen speak at the INET conference in 2011.

Fast forward to June 2013, and the first ever public unveiling of 'Off Grid' (in a livestreamed interview at Etoo London) just happened to fall nearly 64 years to the day after the publishing of George Orwell's book, 1984, and the same week that Edward Snowden made his first leak.
