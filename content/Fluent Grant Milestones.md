# Description:

Provides runway for an O’Ruggin Trail prototype getting to testnet  and mainnet alpha launches using MUD / EVM, and researching ways to include Rust or other conventional programming language based features for showcasing blended execution.

Initial prototypes for Bridgebuilder to explore UGC discovery and incentivization between players and games, the opportunities for it potentially being cross VM / chain and having outposts in each significant Games IP ecosystem, and an opportunity to take learnings from building O'Ruggin with blendedVM features to  inform potential for using allowances brought forward by Blended execution in Bridgebuilder.

### Milestone 1/ upfront startup payment:

- [x]  A starting payment to kick off development

---
### Milestone 2:

See report [here](Archetypal-Fluent-Site/Fluent/Fluent-M2-report.md).

- [x] O'Ruggin - expand rust tooling for User generated content

- [x] O'Ruggin - design & research ways in which blended execution give rise to new mechanics or features for O’Ruggin

- [x] Bb - UX, FE prototypes pass 1

- [x] Bb - start design process around researching what blended execution can bring to Bridgebuilder.

---
### Milestone 3:

- [x] O'Ruggin - expansion of core gameplay and content 

- [x] O'Ruggin - feature driven development, iterating with regular playtests 

- [x] O'Ruggin - tests around ways in which blended execution give rise to new mechanics or features for O’Ruggin

- [x] O'Ruggin - "soft" Testnet releases and playtesting from Nov 

- [x] Bb - UX, FE prototypes pass 2

- [x] Bb - continue design process around researching what blended execution can bring to Bridgebuilder.

### Milestone 4: (additional)

Current Tues 11th Feb (move Tues the 4th)

- [ ] A working start on a CICD system to make MUD to Fluent deployments standardized (work locally / pass tests, and push to chain).

in addition to :

- [ ] O'Ruggin - design work and expansion of core gameplay and content 

- [ ] Bb - continued design process around UX, FE prototypes and researching what blended execution can bring to Bridgebuilder (e.g Tongueknot: O'Ruggin Bb integration)
#### *Context:

*We've been taking Fluent tooling to compile contracts / integrate our more complex project into their templates*

*The build system provided is on hardhat, our project is foundry deployment system, we need to make these things talk together so that we can develop back and forth, build contract, copy ABIs to front end, deploy contracts to locally running node, and build client, all locally and then be able to move this into a system that when these tests are passed do deployment or contract upgrade to test / mainnet. Currently it is a manual / semi automated process because there are so many variants.*

*This needs to be in a useable CI/CD system, eventually we want a zero config solution that we can use and then other MUD developers can make use of.*

*Over the course of the rest of the project this is a tool we will iterate and use for development and therefore document / and maintain to make it a process future MUD developers can follow for easy MUD deployments to Fluent.*

### Milestone 5:

Mid - March

- [ ] O'Ruggin -  Create content that overlaps with other games on Fluent or Using MUD to highlight composability

- [ ] O'Ruggin - feature driven development, iterating with regular playtests 

- [ ] O'Ruggin - tests around ways in which blended execution give rise to new mechanics or features for O’Ruggin

- [ ] O'Ruggin - focus on multiplayer / multi user mechanics, potentially with a resource that needs to be collected and used in order for players to "commit" user generated content to the shared world.

- [ ] Bb - tests around what blended execution can bring to Bridgebuilder.

---
### Milestone 6:

Late April / Early May

- [ ] O'Ruggin - expansion of core gameplay and content 

- [ ] O'Ruggin - feature driven development, iterating with regular playtests

- [ ] O'Ruggin - "alpha" mainnet release or significant  testnet if mainnet not ready

- [ ] Bb - test smart contracts behind Bb making use of Blended execution (should the previous goals yield positive results)
